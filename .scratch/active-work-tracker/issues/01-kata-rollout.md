# Configure TorchTitan for the active-work control plane

Type: task
Status: ready-for-agent
Blocked by: ultron:06-policy-and-synchronization
Parent: ultron:.scratch/active-work-tracker/spec.md

Receive the managed active-work policy, instruction pointer, manifest binding,
and `.kata.toml` project configuration while preserving the AGENTS symlink and
existing dirty mainline work.

Evidence: Ultron sync check, exact pointer count, symlink verification, and
`git diff --check`.
